# Tic Tac Toe with AI - CS50 AI Final Project (Week 0)

Welcome to my **Tic Tac Toe with AI** project! This is my first project for the **CS50 AI** course, where I developed a web-based Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make decisions and provide an unbeatable challenge.

## 🎮 Live Demo
Check out the live version of the game: [Tic Tac Toe with AI](https://itzdineshx.github.io/Cs50ai_tic_tac_toe_AI/)

## 🛠️ Features
- **Single-player mode**: Play against the AI, which always makes the optimal move.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use design for a great user experience.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy sound effects for actions like resetting the game.
- **Smart AI**: The Minimax algorithm ensures the AI never loses.
- **Reset Button**: Quickly restart the game with a simple button click.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Players take turns placing X and O marks on the grid.
2. The goal is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
3. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to calculate the best possible move and provide an unbeatable challenge.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game and page.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for game play and the AI algorithm.
- **Font Awesome**: Social media icons in the footer.
